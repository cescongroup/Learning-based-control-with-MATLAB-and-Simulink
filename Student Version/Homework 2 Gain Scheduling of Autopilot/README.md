# Homework 2 Gain Scheduling of Autopilot 

Gain scheduling; where controller parameters are adjusted based on direct measurements of system and environmental parameters, is the common solution for high-performance aircraft. 
In this exercise, we go through the process of gain scheduling step-by-step, where the user gains an understanding of the advantages and limitations of gain scheduling.
