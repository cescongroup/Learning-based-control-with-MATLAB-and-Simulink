# Homework 4 Learning Dynamical Systems in Real Time 

In this approach, experiments are performed on the system by exciting its dynamics in order to collect data. A model, then, is fitted to the generated data by assigning suitable numerical values to its parameters. Often, it happens that a model based on first-principles contains a number of unknown parameters. Identification methods can be applied to estimate the unknown parameters. 
In this homework we will study a method to update the model's parameter estimates obtain with system identification in real-time.
