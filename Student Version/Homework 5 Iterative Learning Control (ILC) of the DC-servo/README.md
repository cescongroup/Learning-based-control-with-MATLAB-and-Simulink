# Homework 5 Iterative Learning Control (ILC) of the DC-servo

Iterative Learning Control (ILC) is founded on the idea that a system's performance in repetitive tasks can improve by learning from previous attempts. ILC aims to create a feedforward control that follows a specific reference or mitigates recurring disturbances. In this exercise, we will explore ILC techniques, examine its advantages over traditional feedback and feedforward controllers, and compare it to other learning-based control strategies, such as adaptive control.
