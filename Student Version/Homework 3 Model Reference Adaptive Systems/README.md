# Homework 3 Model Reference Adaptive Systems 




introduction to adaptive control,
in particular Model Reference Adaptive Systems (MRAS). It will cover controller parameters adaptation rules
based on gradients and Lyapunov theory, respectively
## Learning Goals
- Introduction to adaptive control, in particular Model Reference Adaptive Systems (MRAS).
- Cover controller parameters adaptation rules based on gradients and Lyapunov theory.
- Learn about the use and application of the MRAC Simulink block.
## Setup
Open the MATLAB Live Script [Homework 3 Model Reference Adaptive Systems.mlx](https://github.com/cescongroup/Learning-based-control-with-MATLAB-and-Simulink/blob/main/Student%20Version/Homework%203%20Model%20Reference%20Adaptive%20Systems/Homework%203%20Model%20Reference%20Adaptive%20Systems.mlx) and run each section as directed. Implement the model for each task using the given libraries: [Library_1.slx]() and [Library_2,slx]()
