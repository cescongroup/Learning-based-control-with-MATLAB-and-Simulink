# Homework 3 Model Reference Adaptive Systems 

Adaptive control is the design of a controller that can adapt to parameter variations. This exercise will cover introduction to adaptive control, in particular Model Reference Adaptive Systems (MRAS). It will cover controller parameters adaptation rules based on gradients and Lyapunov theory, respectively.

## Learning Goals
- Use Simulink to implement adaptation rules based on gradients and Lyapunov theory.
- Learn about the use and application of the MRAC Simulink block.

## Setup
Open the MATLAB Live Script [Homework 3 Model Reference Adaptive Systems.mlx](https://github.com/cescongroup/Learning-based-control-with-MATLAB-and-Simulink/blob/main/Student%20Version/Homework%203%20Model%20Reference%20Adaptive%20Systems/Homework%203%20Model%20Reference%20Adaptive%20Systems.mlx) and run each section as directed. Implement the model for each task using the given libraries: [Library_1.slx](https://github.com/cescongroup/Learning-based-control-with-MATLAB-and-Simulink/blob/main/Student%20Version/Homework%203%20Model%20Reference%20Adaptive%20Systems/Library_1.slx) and [Library_2.slx](https://github.com/cescongroup/Learning-based-control-with-MATLAB-and-Simulink/blob/main/Student%20Version/Homework%203%20Model%20Reference%20Adaptive%20Systems/Library_2.slx).
